// There are two ways you can let other developers access your packages
// --- Option 1. Leaving as it is
// And developer can access your packages by `import { ConflictError } from '@jiptickets/common/errors/conflict-error'
// The cons of this is that the dev have to know which path does the object located
// --- Option 2. Put everything in `index.ts` (the main file which would be later known as `index.js`)
// Developer will be able to access using `import { ConflictError } from '@jiptickets/common`
// We will go with option 2!
